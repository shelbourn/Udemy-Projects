*/

ORDER BY FIRST_NAME;

-- Using the IN operator (OR for values)
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY IN (10000, 25000, 17000); -- The order of the values is not important

/* Using the LIKE operator. Usually used with _ or %
_ means one character
% means zero or more characters
*/

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE '__s%'; -- All first names where the third character is an 's'

-- Now suppose there is a value in any column containing _ or % (i.e. job_id)
-- Then there must be a special way to search for these characters

-- Incorrect method for searching
SELECT JOB_ID
FROM JOBS
WHERE JOB_ID LIKE 'SA_%'; -- This would include 'SAP cons' which has a space when we are only looking for jobs that start with 'SA_'

-- Correct method of searching
SELECT JOB_ID
FROM JOBS
WHERE JOB_ID LIKE 'SA/_%' escape '/'; -- The '/' escapes the character that follows it

-- Another example: Suppose we have a job_id called MANA%GER
-- And we need to pick all the JOB_ID that have the '%' character
SELECT JOB_ID
FROM JOBS
WHERE JOB_ID LIKE '%/%%' escape '/'; -- Retrieves all JOB_ID that include the character '%'

-- Using the IS NULL operator
SELECT FIRST_NAME, COMMISSION_PCT
FROM EMPLOYEES;

-- Select employees who do not receive commission
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE COMMISSION_PCT IS NULL;

-- Incorrect useage
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE COMMISSION_PCT=NULL;

-- Using NOT Operater
-- Can also use NOT IN, NOT LIKE, IS NOT NULL, NOT BETWEEN AND

SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID NOT IN (100, 101);

SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE COMMISSION_PCT IS NOT NULL;

SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE FIRST_NAME NOT LIKE 'S%'; -- All employees who's names do not begin with the letter 'S'

-- Using the NOT EQUAL operator
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID <> 50;

-- Above is the same as...
select *
from employees
where department_id != 50;

-- Using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
-- Defining conditions using the logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
-- The AND operator requires that both arguements are TRUE
select employee_id, last_name, job_id, department_id
from employees
where salary >= 10000
and department_id = 90
order by last_name;

-- The OR operator requires that either arguement be TRUE
select employee_id, last_name, job_id, department_id
from employees
where salary >= 10000
or department_id = 90
order by last_name;

-- Another example using multiple AND operators
select employee_id, last_name, job_id, salary, department_id, commission_pct
from employees
where salary > 2000
and department_id in (60, 90)
and commission_pct is null
order by last_name;

-- IMPORTANT
-- SQL execution with logical operators has priorities
-- AND takes precedence over OR
-- In this statement 'JOB_ID = 'AD_PRES' AND SALARY > 15000' will execute first
select last_name , job_id, salary
from employees
where job_id = 'SA_REP' -- First condition
or job_id = 'AD_PRES' and salary > 15000 -- Second condition
order by last_name;

-- The query above is the same as this...
select last_name, job_id, salary
from employees
where job_id = 'SA_REP'
or (job_id = 'AD_PRES' and salary > 15000)
order by last_name;

/* RULES OF PRECEDENCE

1.) Arithmetic Operators
2.) Concatenation Operator
3.) Comparison conditions
4.) IS [NOT] NULL, LIKE, [NOT] IN
5.) [NOT] BETWEEN
6.) Not equal to
7.) NOT logical operator
8.) AND logical operator
9.) OR logical operator

You can use parenthesis () or brackets [] to override rules of precedence
*/

-- When you use parenthesis you can override any priorities
select last_name, job_id, salary
from employees
where (job_id = 'SA_REP' or job_id = 'AD_PRES') -- First condition
and salary > 15000 -- Second condition
order by last_name;

-- BEST PRACTICE IS TO USE PARENS FOR CONDITIONS

-- Using the ORDER BY clause
select * from employees
order by hire_date; -- The default order is always ASC (ascending)

select * from employees
order by hire_date ASC; -- Same as above. No need to put ASC because the default is always ASC

-- ORDER BY descending
select * from employees
order by hire_date desc;

-- Using WHERE and ORDER BY
select * from employees
where department_id = 90
order by employee_id;

-- NULL values in ORDER BY ** IMPORTANT **
select * from employees
order by commission_pct; -- NULL values come last by default in ascending order

select * from employees
order by commission_pct desc; -- NULL values come first by default in descending order

-- NULLS FIRST makes NULLS appear first, then the remainder of the results ordered in ascending order by default
select * from employees
order by commission_pct nulls first;

-- You can use ORDER BY using aliases as well
select first_name n -- n given as alias to FIRST_NAME
from employees
order by n;

-- Ordering by expressions
select employee_id, salary, salary + 100
from employees
order by salary + 100;

-- Can order by columns not in the SELECT statement
select employee_id, salary
from employees
order by department_id; -- but this is not logical and not recommended.

-- Can order by more than one column
select department_id, first_name, salary
from employees
order by department_id, first_name; -- orders first by department_id and then by first_name

select department_id, first_name, salary
from employees
order by department_id asc, first_name desc;

-- Can order by the column number as it appears in the SELECT statement
select department_id, first_name, salary
from employees
order by 1; -- refers to the first column named in the SELECT statement (DEPARTMENT_ID)

select department_id, first_name, salary
from employees
order by 1, 3; -- Order by column 1 and then by column 3

-- Using the FETCH clause (Used for top-end queries i.e. top 3 sales people)
-- Using SQL row limition clause in query
select employee_id, first_name
from employees
order by employee_id;

select employee_id, first_name
from employees
order by employee_id
fetch first 5 rows only;

select employee_id, first_name
from employees
order by employee_id
fetch first 50 percent rows only;

select employee_id, first_name
from employees
order by employee_id
offset 5 rows fetch next 5 rows only;

select employee_id, first_name
from employees
order by employee_id
offset 4 rows fetch next 50 percent rows only;

-- Using TIES with FETCH
select employee_id, first_name, salary
from employees
order by salary desc;

select employee_id, first_name, salary
from employees
order by salary desc
fetch first 2 rows only; -- Even though record 2 and 3 both have the same salary, this query will only retrieve the first two records

select employee_id, first_name, salary
from employees
order by salary desc
fetch first 2 rows with ties; -- Includes both records that have the same salary

-- Using substitution variables
/*
Use substitution variables to:
Temporarily store values with single ampersand (&) and double ampersand (&&) substitution
Use substitution variables to supplement the following:
WHERE conditions
ORDER BY clauses
Column expressions
Table names
Entire SELECT statments
*/

select employee_id, last_name, salary, department_id
from employees
where employee_id = &employee_num; -- When using the single (&) the variable will be discarded after it is used

-- Using (&) with VARCHAR
select employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary, department_id
from employees
where first_name = '&ename' -- FIRST_NAME tied to variable 'ename'. STRINGS ARE CASE-SENSITIVE!!!
order by 2;

-- The query above is the same as this...
select employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary, department_id
from employees
where first_name = &ename -- With no sing quote marks now you have to include the quotes in the SQL prompt window
order by 2;
